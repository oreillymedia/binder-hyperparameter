    "\n",
    "In the first section, I will introduce the concept of model validation in machine learning: applying a machine learning model to a set of data with known labels, in order to evaluate how well the model works. Showing the poor results of a naive approach to this will motivate the concept of “holdout sets” or “test sets.” Finally, by noting the weaknesses of the holdout set approach, I will introduce the concept of cross-validation.\n",
